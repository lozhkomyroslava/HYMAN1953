In this experiment, we conducted a task-switching paradigm to assess participants' task-switching abilities. The task-switching paradigm is designed to measure the difficulty of rapidly shifting attention between two different tasks. In our study, the tasks involved responding to different features of the stimuli presented.

The experiment consisted of a rectangular frame divided into upper and lower sections. The labels "shape" and "filling" were displayed above and below the frame, respectively. Four imperative stimuli were used in different trials, which were combinations of two shapes (diamond and rectangle) and two or three circles as filling. The frame and stimuli were presented in yellow color against a black background. Feedback messages indicating incorrect responses or time running out were provided after each trial.

There were two tasks in this experiment: the shape task and the filling task. In the shape task, participants had to respond based on the shape of the imperative stimuli (diamonds required a left response, rectangles required a right response). In the filling task, participants had to respond based on the number of circles within the shape (two circles required a left response, three circles required a right response). Importantly, both task dimensions (shape and filling) were always present, and the two dimensions required opposite responses in half of the trials, creating incongruent stimuli. This required participants to determine which task to perform and attend to the relevant stimulus dimension.

Participants completed three training blocks consisting of 40 trials each, followed by three additional blocks (totaling 192 trials) for data analysis. The first imperative stimulus, randomly chosen from the four possible stimuli, appeared, and participants had up to 4 seconds to respond. After a response or the expiration of the response time, the imperative stimulus disappeared. Incorrect responses or failures to respond were followed by a 5-second reminder of the stimulus-response mapping and a 500 ms pause. The intertrial interval lasted 800 ms.

The primary objective of this experiment was to investigate both mixing costs and switch costs. Mixing costs refer to the slowing down observed when participants switch between tasks compared to performing a block of pure trials. Switch costs specifically refer to the additional slowing down observed on trials immediately following a task switch. By measuring these costs, we aimed to assess participants' ability to switch tasks efficiently and examine the impact of task-switching demands on cognitive performance.
